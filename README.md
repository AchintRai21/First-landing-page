# First-landing-page
A frontend mentor project
This This project is a responsive landing page built with HTML and CSS, created as part of my frontend practice. The layout is structured with semantic HTML and styled using modern CSS techniques such as flexbox and grid for alignment, utility classes for reusability, and CSS custom properties for consistent theming (colors, spacing, and typography). The project includes a polished hero section, feature cards, call-to-action areas, and a structured footer with logos and links. No frameworks or external libraries were used â€” the design was replicated purely from a reference image without access to a Figma file, making spacing and typography a matter of careful approximation. The goal of this project was to strengthen my ability to translate static design references into clean, maintainable code while building confidence with responsive layouts and scalable CSS structure.
